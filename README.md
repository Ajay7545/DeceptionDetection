# DeceptionDetection
Deception Detection Project using EEG Classification (Machine Learning Project)

Deception detection, brain signals are useful in lie detetction. As Electroencephalogram signals reveal fine features of state of mind of subject and thoughts of subject make it better tool for lie detection. 
The main purpose of this project is to enhance the existing methods for classifying the familiar and unfamiliar face images. There are numeraous experiments were done on visual stimuli based EEG signals.
In this project we will try to classify the familiar and unfamiliar visual stimuli obtaied in the form of EEG from subject. As the EEG signals are bilogical and non stationary in nature and time series, we will try to obtain the,
component aof EEG though some data driven approaches by decomposing them. We try to build new deep learning model for the classification of familiar and unfamilar images.


Brain signals were started to use in deception detection process from last few years. 
EEG signals can reveal many important features of our thought which make it as a better tool for deception detection. 
A number of experiments were done in terms of visual stimuli based EEG signals.
The purpose of this paper is to improvise the existing methods in the classification of familiar and unfamiliar faces
which can be used as a basic model in deception detection. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning based classification of
EEG signals for the given visual stimuli. In this experiment, the subjects were shown by familiar and unfamiliar faces.,We will 
build a model which  for classification. By training
the model properly which is far better than the models using conventional machine learning
methods. Our model achieved the state of the art results for classification of familiar and unfamiliar EEG signals.
